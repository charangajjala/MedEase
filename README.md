## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/charangajjala/medEase_portal.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server
   ```sh
    npm run dev
   ```
5. By default the application opens at the port 5173 but it can be altered in the `vite.config.js` file. If the port is changed, the backend URL in the `./backend/src/main/java/com/chapp/med_ease/config/WebConfig.java` file should also be updated by changing the `allowedOrigins` value.
6. After initiating the frontend side, we should also start the backend server. The backend server is a Spring Boot application and can be started by running the `MedEaseApplication.java` file in the `./backend/src/main/java/com/chapp/med_ease` directory.
7. By default frontend application uses the default backend URL `http://localhost:8080` but it can be altered in the `./frontend/src/api/axios.jsx` file.
8. After a successful build, we need to make sure the database is up and running. The database schema is provided in the `./backend/src/main/resources` directory. The database configuration can be altered in the `./backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

## Usage üßë‚Äçüíª

The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Both the admin and user have a common login page. The admin credentials can be added to the database manually. The admin has access to all the features of the application which includes

- Inventory Management
- Order Management
- Company Management
- Product Category Management
- Statistics of the sales and inventory

The user has access to the shopping page where they can perform operations like

- Viewing products
- Adding products to the cart
- Placing orders
- Viewing order history
- Viewing seller and company details (Under development)
- Searching for products
- Viewing product categories
- Adding and updating customer details

Other features like loading animations and notifications are also included in the application. Most of the features are self-explanatory and application is desgned to be user-friendly.

Apart from this the application is made responsive and can be accessed from any device. But it is recommended to use the application on a desktop for a better experience. The applicatioon is also designed to be secure and the user data is encrypted and stored in the database. The application is also designed to be scalable and can be easily extended to include more features.

## How it works üìù

### Database Schema

This schema is designed to include the seller feature which is under development. This is getting carried on as a part of the future work. Currently the application has the admin and user features.

### Authentication

The application currently uses Role based login and JWT for authentication. The application has two types of users

- ADMIN
- USER
